      <description>What is a HackerBox:
HackerBoxes is a subscription based service that sends out monthly electronics boxes with project attached to them.
These projects range over a wide gamit of things and can include anything from components with a &amp;ldquo;free-range&amp;rdquo; aspect to fully built systems.
Why do I order them:
These boxes open me up to new products and components I may not have been aware of at the time, or force me to rethink how I&amp;rsquo;ve been using existing components that have been a part of my arsenal for years.</description>

      <description>What is the Magnum Opus:
A Magnum Opus is a large collection of a persons speciality, wether that be art, music, literature or something else. And is regarded as the most imporant piece of work from that person. In my situation my Magnum Opus project is a project that is never ending essentially. It is a project where I challenge myself to build something that uses all of my current skills and knowledge and will be able to be continued to be expanded up on.</description>

      <description>Why build when you can buy:
I take my privacy very serious, so why should I trust a major firm like Amazon or an obsecure firm like Yi to monitor my house when I know I can build my own system. (I would say and do it better but we all know that is a lie)
Additionally it should provide a fun challenge and open myself up more to IOT and different protocols such as UDP/TCP and SMTP.</description>

      <description>The PCB:
This schematic was created using Eagle. It is a functional but non-optimized design. Feel free to reach out for a copy of the Eagle Schematic and Board design.

      <description>What is a Binary Clock:
A Binary Clock is a clock that shows the time as a binary value. For example 12:49 will be displayed as 1100 110001 (it should be noted this is seperating hours and minutes as seperate binary values for the purpose of displaying).
Why this project:
The Binary Clock is a common engineering project. The reason I choose to tackle this project was due to dynamic nature of the project.</description>

      <description>Hello my name is Vincent,
Although I tend to work under different aliasses depending on what I am doing :) (In this case everything links back to my github one which is The-Lifting-Engineer)
I&amp;rsquo;m an Electrical Engineer, Tinkerer, Racer and absolute nervous wreck 9 times out of 10.
This website is a museum/monument to my projects. (I&amp;rsquo;ve been told the corporate/professional word is portifolio) I will also be using this as a reflection point to see areas I can improve up on with each new project.</description>

      <description>What is a VISOR:
VISOR was my Senior Design project, it was completed by myself and a 3 other engineers. This will be a shorter intro due to all of the information relating to this project being available online here
My personal role within this project was mostly related to the sensor input from the motorcycle to the helmet, designing the PCB layout and running simulations to verify our design would work as intended.</description>

      <description>What is the Helmet Add-On:
The Helmet Add-On was my design for the 2015 Brains Awards competition. This is an international engineering competition held in Netherlands. I had orginally entered the competition as a joke submitting my papers about a week before the deadline. And much to my suprise I heard that they had accepted my papers and I was a top 20 finalist. I was expected to present my idea about a month or two later.</description>

      <description>The Box:
This was a fun box to tackle, the main things I learned from this box was using RFID based chips and antennas. The reason this is fun is because it appeals to my more base instincts of wanting to read data, especially the type I shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be able to. Although this box came with some suggested projects I will only be reviewing the code for these.
