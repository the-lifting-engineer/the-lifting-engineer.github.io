      <description>What is a HackerBox:
HackerBoxes is a subscription based service that sends out monthly electronics boxes with project attached to them.
These projects range over a wide gamit of things and can include anything from components with a &amp;ldquo;free-range&amp;rdquo; aspect to fully built systems.
Why do I order them:
These boxes open me up to new products and components I may not have been aware of at the time, or force me to rethink how I&amp;rsquo;ve been using existing components that have been a part of my arsenal for years.</description>

      <description>The Box:
This was a fun box to tackle, the main things I learned from this box was using RFID based chips and antennas. The reason this is fun is because it appeals to my more base instincts of wanting to read data, especially the type I shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be able to. Although this box came with some suggested projects I will only be reviewing the code for these.
