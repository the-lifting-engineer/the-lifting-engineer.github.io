Although I tend to work under different aliasses depending on what I am doing :) (In this case everything links back to my github one which is The-Lifting-Engineer)
I&rsquo;m an Electrical Engineer, Tinkerer, Racer and absolute nervous wreck 9 times out of 10.
This website is a museum/monument to my projects. (I&rsquo;ve been told the corporate/professional word is portifolio) I will also be using this as a reflection point to see areas I can improve up on with each new project.">

<p>I will upload most of my projects/finding/co-op stuff in here for others to view and ask questions about.<br>
Questions such as: How can he code so poorly? Dear god man can you just comment your stuff? And why can&rsquo;t he use x-component instead of y-component.<br>
(Note: Most of the time it is me asking these questions to the past version of me)</p>
