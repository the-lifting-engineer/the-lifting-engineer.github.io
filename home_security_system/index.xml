      <description>Why build when you can buy:
I take my privacy very serious, so why should I trust a major firm like Amazon or an obsecure firm like Yi to monitor my house when I know I can build my own system. (I would say and do it better but we all know that is a lie)
Additionally it should provide a fun challenge and open myself up more to IOT and different protocols such as UDP/TCP and SMTP.</description>
